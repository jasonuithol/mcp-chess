Bitboards implement a [finite set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set) of up to 64 elements - all the [squares](/Squares "Squares") of a [chessboard](/Chessboard "Chessboard"). There is a [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) one-to-one correspondence between bits of a bitboard and the squares of a board, but there are many different ways to create this mapping. Some various considerations on this mapping are listed here.

# Square and Bitindex

In the strict sense there are even three finite sets with bijective one-to-one correspondence.

- A set of all squares on a chessboard for from a1 to h8 (A1 to H8). The 8 [ranks](/Ranks "Ranks") of a board are labeled from 1 to 8.The 8 [files](/Files "Files") of a board are labeled from 'a' to 'h' (or 'A' to 'H').
- A set of all 64 squares enumerated from 0..63 (or 1..64).
- The 64 bits inside a bitboard may be enumerated in different orders. (FirstOne versus LastOne, Forward versus Reverse).

Usually we define the bit-indices in arithmetical order to map bits inside a bitboard to numbers.

- Bit index zero is the least significant bit (LSB = 2^0).
- Bit index 63 is the most significant bit (MSB = 2^63).

The reversed ordering was used as well, motivated by the leading zero count instruction of certain processors.

*In the following we rely on arithmetical bit-order order and focus on how to map squares to numbers, which applies to other 8\*8 board representations as well.*

# Deduction on Files and Ranks

We can deduct square mapping on enumerating [files](/Files "Files") and [ranks](/Ranks "Ranks") from 0 to 7 each.
There are two common approaches to calculate the square-index from file or rank,
Least Significant File Mapping or Least Significant Rank Mapping.

```
LSF squareIndex = 8*rankIndex + fileIndex
LSR squareIndex = 8*fileIndex + rankIndex
```

LSR mapping has some advantages in calculating [pawn attacks](/Pawn_Attacks_(Bitboards) "Pawn Attacks (Bitboards)"), since there are no wraps to consider. Anyway, more common is LSF-mapping where ranks are aligned to the eight consecutive bytes of a bitboard and we **further rely on LSF-mapping**.

```
squareIndex = 8*rankIndex + fileIndex
FileIndex   = squareIndex modulo 8  = squareIndex & 7
RankIndex   = squareIndex div    8  = squareIndex >> 3
```

# Endianness

*Main article: [Endianness](/Endianness "Endianness")*
The question remains how to enumerate files and ranks. There are two different orders each, [little-endian](/Little-endian "Little-endian") versus [big-endian](/Big-endian "Big-endian") order of bits and bytes. Thus in total four possible alternatives. The drawback of **little endian** file mapping becomes aware if we write bitboards as binary or hexadecimal strings, since we usually write numbers **big endian** wise.

Anyway, further we rely on little-endian mapping of files and ranks though, since we retain a kind of "natural" relation - that is a < h and 0 < 7.

```
Rank 1 .. Rank 8 -> 0..7
A-File .. H-File -> 0..7
```

To convert from little-endian file mapping to big-endian file mapping and vice versa:

```
squareIndexBigEndianFile    = squareIndexLittleEndianFile ^ 7;
squareIndexLittleEndianFile = squareIndexBigEndianFile    ^ 7;
```

To convert from little-endian rank mapping to big endian-rank mapping and vice versa:

```
squareIndexBigEndianRank    = squareIndexLittleEndianRank ^ 56;
squareIndexLittleEndianRank = squareIndexBigEndianRank    ^ 56;
```

One may combine both conversions in one step by xoring with 63.

### Square Enumeration

Little endian rank-file (LERF) mapping implies following C++ enumeration:

```
enum enumSquare {
  a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, h1,
  a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2,
  a3, b3, c3, d3, e3, f3, g3, h3,
  a4, b4, c4, d4, e4, f4, g4, h4,
  a5, b5, c5, d5, e5, f5, g5, h5,
  a6, b6, c6, d6, e6, f6, g6, h6,
  a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7,
  a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, h8
};
```

### Compass Rose

We rely on the [compass rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_rose) to identify [ray-directions](/Direction "Direction") with following increments to neighbored squares.

```
  noWe         nort         noEa
          +7    +8    +9
              \  |  /
  west    -1 <-  0 -> +1    east
              /  |  \
          -9    -8    -7
  soWe         sout         soEa
```

### Some hexadecimal Constants
